DEVELOPMENT STAGE: Intended functions implemented.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

  The program should be able to some extent handle Spotify playlists. At the
  moment it's through a command-line interface.

  Indeed, this project is mainly copied code from the two example projects
  spshell and jukebox. Both of which are under Spotifys ownership, and are
  included when downloading libspotify.


COMPILATION:

  0. If you haven't installed libspotify and tested the provided
     example programs, then do so first.

  1. Put your appkey.c into the folder. appkey.c contains the application key
     provided by Spotify, it should be very similiar to example_appkey.c.
     Note that the application key is only provided to Spotify premium users.
     
  2. Open a terminal in the folder and run the command 'make'.
  
  3. Run the program.
  
COMPILATION TROUBLESHOOTING:
  
  Even though I wish, I doubt compilation will work right away. So I
  write a list of typical errors:
  
  * For some reason, neither of <readline/readline.h> and <readline/history.h>
    where "include-able" for me at first. But I just googled it
    which told me to install the package 'libreadline5-dev' and then it worked.
  
  * Make sure that libspotify is installed.
  
  * Try to succesfully compile and run (not just compile!) the
    example program 'spshell' that were included in the 
    version of libspotify that you installed. Doing that will
    greatly increase the chance of that 


USAGE:

  1. Login using your normal spotify login, the very same you use
     to login inside the program.
     
  2. Type help and then you're on your off on your own! :)

FURTHER NOTES:

  I used libspotify v0.0.4. And developed it in a Ubuntu environment.
  I have not tested it on any other system.
