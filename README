DEVELOPMENT STAGE: Not near completion.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

This is an attempt by Arash Rouhani to make a interactive cmd-line program.

The program should be able to some extent handle Spotify playlists.

It's intended to be able to compile itself simply by running "> make".

Indeed, this project is mainly copied code from the two example projects
spshell and jukebox. Both of which are under Spotifys ownership.
